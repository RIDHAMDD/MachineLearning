# RNN Model for Sentiment Analysis
This project involves the development of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to perform sentiment analysis. Using PyTorch, a leading deep learning library, we explore the intricacies of RNN architectures to process textual data for understanding sentiments expressed in texts.

# Overview
The notebook details the process of creating a character-level language model using PyTorch, starting from preprocessing the dataset to training and evaluating the RNN model. Special attention is given to the data structures in Python that facilitate efficient data handling and manipulation for deep learning tasks.

# Prerequisites
Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
These can be installed via pip or conda, depending on your Python environment setup.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project involves text data suitable for sentiment analysis. It is preprocessed to fit a character-level model, where the model learns from sequences of characters to predict sentiments. Details about the dataset size, source, and preprocessing steps are included in the notebook.

# Model Description
The RNN model developed in this notebook is designed to understand the sequential nature of text data. It uses layers of recurrent neural networks to process input text, capturing temporal dependencies between characters to predict sentiment labels (e.g., positive or negative).

# Conclusion
The notebook concludes with the evaluation of the RNN model's performance on the sentiment analysis task. Insights into the model's predictions, along with potential areas for improvement, are discussed.

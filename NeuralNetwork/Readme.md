# Training the Iris Dataset using a Neural Network
This file demonstrates the process of training a neural network on the famous Iris dataset using PyTorch. The notebook follows a structured approach, starting from the basic concepts of neural networks to the implementation and evaluation of a model trained on the Iris dataset.

## Introduction
This notebook begins with a question exploring the capability of a neural network to learn complex functions, inspired by the implementation of neural networks in PyTorch as described in a referenced book.

## Evaluating the Trained Model
After training the neural network, this section discusses how to evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset.

## Choosing Activation Functions
The notebook explores various activation functions that can be used in neural networks, including logistic functions, softmax for multiclass classification, hyperbolic tangent, and ReLU activations. Each function's theoretical background and practical application are discussed.

## Generating and Preparing Data
This section covers the process of generating the Iris dataset and preparing it for loading into the model, including data normalization and splitting into training and test sets.

## Modifying the Model Class
Modifications to the neural network model class are made to adapt to the Iris dataset and the specific requirements of the training process.

## Training a Revised Model
Finally, the notebook concludes with an attempt to train a revised model on the Iris dataset, incorporating the lessons learned throughout the notebook.

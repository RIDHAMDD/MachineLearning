# Text Cleaning and Processing with IMDb Dataset
This Jupyter notebook delves into the intricacies of text cleaning and processing, using a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDb. It is structured to guide you through semantic analysis and sentence categorization, demonstrating various text processing techniques.

## Overview
The notebook utilizes a cleaner version of the IMDb dataset than the one mentioned in the textbook, which can be directly downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset is instrumental in showcasing how to handle real-world text data, from cleaning to processing and analysis.

## Features
Dataset Preparation: Instructions on how to download and prepare the IMDb dataset for analysis.
Text Cleaning: Techniques for cleaning text data, including removing HTML tags, stopwords, and non-alphabetic characters.
Text Processing: Methods for tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming, preparing texts for analysis.
Semantic Analysis: Exploration of sentence categorization based on sentiment (positive or negative reviews) using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implementation of machine learning models to classify movie reviews and evaluate their performance.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook

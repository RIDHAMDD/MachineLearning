# SVM Model Implementation in Scikit-learn
This repository contains an IPython Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using Scikit-learn, one of the most popular machine learning libraries in Python. The notebook is structured to guide you through various SVM configurations and their applications on different datasets, including a section on MNIST, a classic dataset for hand-written digit recognition.

## Features
Introduction to SVM: The notebook begins with a basic introduction to SVM concepts and how they can be applied to classification problems.
SVM with Different Kernels: It explores SVM models with different kernel functions, including linear, polynomial (poly), and radial basis function (rbf) kernels, to showcase their impact on model performance.

## MNIST Digit Recognition: 
A section dedicated to applying SVM on the MNIST dataset to classify hand-written digits.
Performance Evaluation: Includes code for evaluating model performance using accuracy scores and decision boundary visualization.

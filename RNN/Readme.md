# Character-level Language Modeling with RNN in PyTorch
This file contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to implement a character-level language model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in PyTorch. The model is trained on a text dataset to predict the next character in a sequence given a sequence of previous characters, enabling the generation of text one character at a time.

## Overview
The notebook covers the following key aspects:

Preprocessing the Dataset: Steps to prepare the text data for training, including reading the file, cleaning the text, and creating character sets.
Data Types in Python: A brief aside on Python data types relevant to data preprocessing, such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
Model Implementation: Detailed steps to implement the RNN model using PyTorch, including defining the model architecture, loss function, and optimization strategy.
Training the Model: Code to train the model on the processed dataset, including monitoring training progress and performance.
Text Generation: Using the trained model to generate text character by character.

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip or conda before running the notebook.

## Implementation Details
The RNN model is implemented using PyTorch's neural network modules.
The notebook includes code snippets for each step, from data preprocessing to model training and text generation.

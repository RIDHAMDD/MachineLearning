# Backpropagation Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements the backpropagation algorithm, a foundational component of neural networks. The implementation is demonstrated using the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits, to train a simple perceptron model for digit classification.

## Sections
The BackPropagation Algorithm: Introduction to the backpropagation algorithm and its significance in training neural networks.
Loading MNIST: Steps to load the MNIST dataset using scikit-learn.
Creating the Perceptron Class: Implementation of a simple perceptron model.
Defining Some Helpful Methods: Utility functions to assist in data loading, and computing loss and accuracy.
Training The Model: Detailed steps to train the perceptron model using the backpropagation algorithm.
Evaluating Model Performance: Methods to evaluate the trained model's performance on unseen data.
Final Accuracy Measure: Presentation of the model's final accuracy on the test set.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizing data.
scikit-learn: For loading the MNIST dataset and preprocessing.

## Implementation Details
This notebook demonstrates the backpropagation algorithm by creating a perceptron class capable of learning from the MNIST dataset. It includes detailed explanations and code for each step of the process, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

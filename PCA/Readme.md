# PCA_Ridham Notebook Overview

This Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive exploration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to various datasets, including a detailed walkthrough of preprocessing steps, PCA implementation, and subsequent analysis. The notebook is structured into three main problems, each targeting a unique aspect of PCA and its application in data analysis and machine learning.

### Problem 1: Understanding PCA with Synthetic Data
Objective: Illustrate the concept of PCA and its impact on data with varying degrees of correlation.
Key Actions:
Generation of two synthetic datasets with different correlation structures.
Visualization of these datasets to intuitively understand the correlation.
Application of PCA to both datasets to analyze the variance explained by the principal components.

### Problem 2: Text Data Preprocessing and Analysis
Objective: Demonstrate text data preprocessing techniques and prepare the text data for PCA.
Key Actions:
Loading a text dataset and performing basic preprocessing steps, including case normalization, removing HTML tags, punctuation, and numbers.
Vectorization of text using CountVectorizer to transform text data into a numerical format suitable for analysis.
Application of TfidfTransformer to convert the count matrix to a normalized tf or tf-idf representation.
Discussion on the importance of these preprocessing steps for text analysis and machine learning applications.

### Problem 3: PCA on Real-world Dataset
Objective: Apply PCA to a real-world dataset to understand feature importance and dimensionality reduction.
Key Actions:
Introduction to a dataset (e.g., breast cancer dataset) and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), including calculating means and variances.
Standardization of the dataset to prepare for PCA.
Application of PCA and analysis of the explained variance ratio to determine the number of components necessary to capture the majority of the variance in the data.
Visualization of cumulative explained variance to decide on the optimal number of principal components.

## Libraries Used
numpy, matplotlib, pandas for data manipulation and visualization.
scikit-learn for PCA, text vectorization, and machine learning models.

## Conclusion
The notebook provides a practical introduction to PCA, showcasing its versatility in handling both synthetic and real-world datasets, including text data. Through detailed examples and code, the reader can grasp how PCA reduces dimensionality, simplifies complex datasets, and uncovers hidden patterns in data.
